I am building nextgen AI bank for the largest digital bank in Vietnam.

I’ve built AI products with over $1M in ARR and 10M+ users for B2B2C at Vietnam's first tech unicorn from 2019 to 2023.

I delivered a keynote on digital identity platforms at IFC World Bank FIDN in 2020.

I won the WSDM Analytics Cup for fake news detection in 2019.

I work with vast amounts of data and numbers daily.

I’m a lifelong learner with a passion for growth. ❤️

Show me your AI, don't tell.
> I craft new paths from sums and signs,
> A builder of AI for changing times.
> From unicorn halls (2019 to 2023),
> I shaped products—ten million strong—set free.

> Their worth soared past one million each year,
> A B2B2C story, loud and clear.
> A keynote shared at IFC’s big stage,
> WSDM Cup won for fake news on the page.

> Now I forge the nextgen AI bank
> For Vietnam’s largest—no steps to shrink.
> In data and numbers, I find my spark,
> Actionable goals lighting up the dark.

> I learn and grow with eyes open wide,
> My passion leads where insight can guide.
> Yet the truest formula I bestow:
> Happiness = P(learning, impact, freedom | ego).
