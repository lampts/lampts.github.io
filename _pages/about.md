I’ve built AI products with over $1M in ARR and 10M+ users for B2B2C at Vietnam's first tech unicorn.

I delivered a keynote on digital identity platforms at IFC World Bank FIDN in 2020.

I won the WSDM Analytics Cup for deep fake detection in 2019.

I work with vast amounts of data and numbers daily.

I’m a lifelong learner with a passion for growth. ❤️
